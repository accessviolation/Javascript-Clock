Javascript-Clock
================

A digital clock utilizing CSS 3D Transforms and JavaScript and jQuery.

The clock needs a CSS3 capable browser to run. Initial testing shows the clock working as intended in Firefox (version 34 tested) and Chrome (version 39 tested). Functionality is present in Internet Explorer, but one of the colons is oddly out of place. That bug will need to be addressed.
